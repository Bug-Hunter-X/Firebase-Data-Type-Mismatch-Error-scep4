This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in Firebase applications: data type mismatches. The bug.js file shows an example of how this error can occur, and the bugSolution.js file provides a solution for handling such errors gracefully.  The error occurs when the expected data type from the Firebase Realtime Database does not match the data type received, potentially leading to unexpected application behavior. The solution demonstrates robust error handling and type checking to prevent crashes and ensure data integrity.
